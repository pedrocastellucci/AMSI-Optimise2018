    "This Notebook will guide us through an example of using matheuristics to solve a particular Mixed Integer Linear Programming model. We begin by implementing the model and then we explore some ideas related to [Local Branching](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10107-003-0395-5) and [Proximity Search](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10732-014-9266-x). Although we are focusing on a particular example, note that the ideas are generic enough to be applied to any optimisation problem defined as $Min\\{c^T x: Ax \\leq b, x \\in \\{0, 1\\}^n\\}$.\n",

    "Without going into much detail about the model, it has the following input parameters:\n",

    "- $w$: a collaborative distribution centre.\n",
    "- $N = S \\cup C \\cup \\{w\\}$:, set of nodes in the network.\n",
    "- $T$: a set of time periods.\n",
    "- $d_{is}$: 1 if consumer $i$ has demand from supplier $s$, 0 otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, the following binary variables were defined:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $x_{ijst}$: indicates whether the truck from supplier $s$ goes from $i$ to $j$ at time period $t$.\n",
    "- $y_{is}$: indicates whether consumer $i$ is visited by supplier $s$.\n",
