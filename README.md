## Hands-on session (AMSI-Optimise, 12-22 June, 2018)


### Abstract:
<i>Logistic distribution problems concern the transportation of goods from origin (supplier) to demand (consumer) points, usually with the goal of minimising routing costs. In this hands-on session, we will describe a simple logistics distribution problem in which suppliers can collaborate with cross-product delivery. Participants will help model, implement and solve the problem using mixed-integer programming. In the second part of this session, these models will be modified to act as heuristic methods and obtain feasible solutions in shorter computational times.

All implementations will be made using Julia Programming Language and the JuMP package using the Juliabox web-based interface. No prior experience with these technologies is required to follow the session.</i>
